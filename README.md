# Neural_FPGA_learn

I am following a lecture series by Vipin Kizheppatt on implement Neural Networks on FPGA. Here is the link to the first lecture: ![Neural Network on FPGA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw_JITpbh3k).

The repo contains codes I wrote following the lecture series, so pretty much copying what he did along the way, so all the credits goes to him. 

Also, it really is the best starting point if someone is looking into learning AI acceleration using FPGAs.
