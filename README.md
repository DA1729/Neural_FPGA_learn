# Neural Processing Unit

This repository contains the design and implementation of a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), which is being developed as part of an ongoing project. Inspired by the ![YouTube series](https://youtu.be/rw_JITpbh3k?si=NpORJeerbtGdDd0W) by Vipin Kizheppatt, the goal of this project is to create a custom hardware accelerator for neural networks. While the initial concept is based on the series, many customizations and optimizations are being implemented to improve functionality and adaptability.

This is an ongoing project, and several modules are still in development. As such, expect incomplete features and evolving designs.

## Current Status

- The **neuron** module is mostly incomplete, as that module is solely left for integrating all the other modules.
- Weight memory control and reading mechanisms are in place but are still being optimized.
- Pretrained model loading functionality is planned but not fully implemented yet.
- Documentation and testbenches are being developed in parallel with the code.

## Inspiration

This NPU design is inspired by the YouTube series mentioned above. While the core concepts are borrowed from the series, the project has evolved with several modifications and improvements to optimize the design and better suit the current goals.
